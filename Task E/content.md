# Objects


JavaScript supports programming with objects. Objects are a way of
organizing the variables. The different screen elements such as Web pages, forms, text boxes, images, and buttons are treated as objects.


### Properties and Methods

Every object has its own properties and methods.
* Properties define the characteristics of an object.
Examples: color, length, name, height, width
* Methods are the actions that the object can perform or that can be performed on the object.
Examples: alert, confirm, write, open, close

### Naming Objects
* Objects are organized in a hierarchy. To refer to an object use :
objectName
* To refer to a property of an object use:
objectName.propertyName
* To refer to a method of an object use:

```objectName.methodName()```
