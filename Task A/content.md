# Introduction To Javascript

### History

JavaScript is a very powerful, versatile, and ubiquitous programming language. It was started in the mid 1990's by Netscape an American computer services company, it's grown to be one of the world's most popular2 programming languages.
JavaScript is unique among programming languages because it's the only one used on practically all personal computers around the world. All modern web browsers implement JavaScript. It's scripting language for the Web.
While it started out as a simple language used for validating forms and minimally
manipulating some content in the page, it's evolved to let you build rich client-side
applications. As the Web continues to grow and evolve, the need for JavaScript developers is increasing.
Whether you're an experienced programmer looking to pick up JavaScript, or a novice wanting to fill some of that demand, this course will help you.

### Uses

Why would you use JavaScript? You could use it for such purposes as client-side validation of form elements (one of the most common), user interaction (drag and drop in a browser window, insert new form elements like textboxes for adding new records to a table), user notification (Facebook notifications), asynchronously retrieving data from a server and loading it into the page (AJAX), server scripting(with a platform called node.js) or a long list of other possible operations. To list every feature of what JavaScript could be used for here would be a heroic effort.

Since it is a prototype language, one can write C style programs in JavaScript.

Since it is a functional language, one can write Lisp style programs in JavaScript.

If you've had any formal training in Computer Science then those two languages may be familiar to you. The majority of computer programs are written in either of those two styles. Since JavaScript allows a developer to write in the style with which he is the most fluent, this can be shown to be a boon as the developer is able to start writing code faster on introduction to the language.

I have seen full fledged games replete with complicated graphics written in JavaScript. I have also seen rudimentary video players (relying on HTML5) with some basic manipulation functionality written in JavaScript.


### Frameworks
* Angular - It is a popular enterprise framework that many developers are using to build and maintain complex web applications. Angular’s popularity is immense, and companies using it are as diverse as Domino’s Pizza, Ryanair, iTunes Connect, PayPal Checkout, Google. Angular is an open source framework supported by Google. Angular describes itself as an extension to HTML for building complex web apps.

*React -  React is open-source and developed mostly by Facebook with contributions from other major tech companies. React describes itself as a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

*Backbone- it is a famously simple framework that fits into a single JavaScript file. Backbone has been around for a while; developed by Jeremy Ashkenas from CoffeeScript and Underscore fame. Backbone is especially popular with teams looking for a simple structure for their small web applications without bringing in a large framework like Angular or Ember.

*Express- it is a framework of javascript used to write web applications and it is very versatile

And many others

### Community

Javascript has a large community on both facebook and twitter
