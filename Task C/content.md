# Variables

Programmers use variables to store values. A variable can hold several types of data. In JavaScript you don't have to declare a variable's data type before using it. Any variable can hold any JavaScript data type, including:

* String data
* Numbers
* Boolean values (T/F)

### Variable Names

There are rules and conventions in naming variables in any programming language. It is good practice to use descriptive names for variables. The following are the JavaScript rules:
* The variable name must start with a letter or an underscore.
firstName or _myName
* You can use numbers in a variable name, but not as the first
character.
name01 or tuition$
* You can't use space to separate characters.
userName not user Name
* Capitalize the first letter of every word except the first
salesTax or userFirstName
Variables
* To declare variables, use the keyword var and the variable name:
var userName
7
* To assign values to variables, add an equal sign and the value:

shell
var userName = "Smith"
var price = 100
