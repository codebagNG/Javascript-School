# Events
The objects in a Web pages are organized in a hierarchy. All objects have properties and methods. In addition, some objects also have "events". Events are things that happen, usually user actions, that are associated with an object. The "event handler" is a command that is used to specify actions in response to an event. Below are some of the most common events:
* onLoad - occurs when a page loads in a browser
* onUnload - occurs just before the user exits a page
* onMouseOver - occurs when you point to an object
* onMouseOut - occurs when you point away from an object
* onSubmit - occurs when you submit a form
* onClick - occurs when an object is clicked

### Events and Objects

Events are things that happen, actions, that are associated with an object. Replacing one image with a second image when the user moves the mouse over it is called a "rollover". The events called for are the "onMouseOver" and "onMouseOut". The object used with these events can be a link or a button.
